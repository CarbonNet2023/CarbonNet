CarbonNet: Enterprise-level Carbon Emission Prediction with Large-scale Datasets

## Overview
CarbonNet is an open-source research project aimed at advancing the understanding of corporate carbon emissions. This project is part of an academic paper submitted to PAKDD 2024 and provides a comprehensive dataset along with analysis tools for studying carbon emissions of companies over a span of 21 years.

## Dataset
The CarbonNet dataset is a robust collection of data encompassing 3,364 companies, spanning a period of 21 years. This dataset includes:

- **Carbon Emission Data:** Detailed records of carbon emissions by each company, providing a critical resource for environmental impact studies.
- **Company Reports:** A collection of company reports, offering insights into corporate environmental policies and practices.

### Data Collection
The dataset has been meticulously built by crawling publicly available information from the internet. Subsequent stages involved meticulous calculation and preprocessing to ensure the integrity and usability of the data for academic research.

## Analysis Tools
Alongside the dataset, CarbonNet provides a suite of analysis tools. These tools are designed to assist researchers in conducting comprehensive analyses of the dataset, facilitating a deeper understanding of corporate carbon emissions and their implications.

## Usage
Researchers and academics are welcome to use this dataset and the accompanying tools for their studies, provided that proper attribution is given to the CarbonNet project and its contributors.
